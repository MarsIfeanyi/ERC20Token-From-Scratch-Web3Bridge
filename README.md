# Building an ERC-20 Token from Scratch @Web3Bridge

Building an ERC-20 Token from Scratch using the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 20 (EIP-20). [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) gives us the standard for Token Creation, hence the name Token Standard.

In the course of my training at [Web3Bridge](https://www.web3bridge.com/) as a Blockchain Developer Intern, we were taught about the EIP-20(ERC-20): Token Standard, and we reviewed the standard using the official documentation [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) and built our Token.

I further did my research and built my own token using the EIP-20 Token Standard, add some documentations to explain my codebase and provide video walk through.
